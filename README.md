# HowToMake

Welcome to my personal blog — a space where I write about things I learn, projects I build, and mistakes I make (and hopefully fix).

## 📌 What You'll Find Here

- 🛠️ Technical deep dives
- 🔍 Debugging stories
- 💡 Side project writeups
- 📚 Learning notes
- 🧪 Experimental ideas

## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I'm a developer who enjoys breaking stuff just to understand how to fix it. I build things, I document things, and I love sharing my journey — wins and fails included.
